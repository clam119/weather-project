# Hi, Thank You For Checking Out This Mini Project - Weather Forecast Application 

## About This Project:

What the application does: This is a simple Weather Forecast Application that was used to practiced API GET Requests and displaying them on the client's browser. 

Motivation Behind Creation: I wanted to learn and understand about making external GET Requests and then displaying these on the client's side.

Key Learning Points Included:
- The set-up for making external GET Requests through; understanding the requirement for the endpoint (URL that contains the information), path & parameters that is used to navigate to the data,
and lastly, the requirement of API Authentication through the use of API keys provided.
- Although, I used Node.js' standard HTTPS Method to retrieve API data, I will be looking to explore to more simple alternatives such as the package "GOT".
- Function(res) - This function is called when a successful connection is made.
- res.on("data", function(data)) - The on("data") function is called when a chunk of data is received.
- on("close") - This is called when a connection to an external API server is closed.
side.

Technologies Used: 
- HTML
- Node.js
- Express.js 
- Nodemon (Express Package) - Monitors changes in your sourcecode and automatically restarts server for faster local development.
- PostMan (External Desktop/Web Application) - An external manager that assists with keeping API keys & API endpoints, paths and parameters.
